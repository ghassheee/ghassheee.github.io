Greenacres Ltd is an old company which has the largest market share except the term from 2000 to 2010. On the other hand, Carsons Ltd is the company which has the smallest market share.
With the emerging Farm Implemented Ltd, the market share of Greenacres Ltd has shrunk from 1995 to 2000, whereas Carsons Ltd did not decrease with the emergence. Carsons Ltd strongly holds the hearts of customers. That is why I could recommend Carsons of the three. It seems that Carsons might sell a good product or its original product, or something else.
The whole market share has grown steadily, and the increasing rate is declining. This meaans the market is near a saturation point. The graph shows Greenacres Ltd had reduced their share by 2 times, which suggests some big addcident might have occured. But in 2012, it has recovered totally and has had again the biggest share then. It is also notable how rapidly and constantly Farm Implements Ltd has grown.

..
Unlike English, for example, Japanese Language has plenty if characters, which allows verbose representations or ambiguities a lot.
The second thing is weather or the environment where a country is located. which determines the amount of rainfall, the temperature, and therefore determines lots of things which is carsed by the factors. In cold regions, people tend to act logically because dancing or playing there get rid of heat from them. Lack of heat cause death immediately. ...
So we have to be careful where a country is situated and supplement the element which the country lacks.
