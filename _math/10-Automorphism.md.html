imagine the rotations of a tetrahedron to itself. Each rotation moves a point to the position which another point was. pick up any 2 faces and name a, b as 120˚ anti-clockwise rotations of each. (so, the above picture is clockwise i.e. it is mirrored and do not mind that.)
$ A _ 4 $ is described only with a, b and their conpositions as id = aaa = bbb.

$ A _ 4 $ = {

~~~
    id,
    aab, aba, baa,
    a, aa,
    b, bb,
    abab, ab,
    baba, ba,
~~~

}



if we define `c := abab`, and `d := baba`, then;

$ A _4  $ = {

~~~
    id,
    aab, aba, baa,    <= 180˚ rotations
    a, aa,
    b, bb,
    c, cc,
    d, dd
~~~

}

where
~~~
a, b, c, d is 120˚ anti-clockwise
aa, bb, cc, dd is 240˚anti-clockwise or 120˚ clockwise
~~~

A member of Aut( $ A _ 4 $ ) should be isomorphism i.e. homomorphic, so it maps `a` to the 120˚ rotations. There is ;

~~~
    a |-> a,b,c,d,aa,bb,cc,dd   (8 patterns)
~~~

if we choose `bb` as the target,

~~~
    a |-> bb
~~~

then because of homomorphism, `aa` is determined like,
~~~
    aa |-> bbbb == b
~~~

Next, determine the target of `b`
Because this function `a` $ \mapsto $ `bb` is `anti-clockwise` $ \mapsto $ `clockwise`
`b` satisfies;

~~~
    b |-> clockwise
~~~

so,
~~~
    b |-> aa,cc,dd (3 patterns)
~~~

so Aut( $ A _ 4 $ ) has 8 x 3 = 24 elements.


but why is this isomorphic to $ S _ 4 $?

# Outer Automorphisms

$ S _ 4 $ is said to be $ G( T _ 6 ) $, as $ A _ 4 $ to $ G( T _ 4) $.<br>
This means we can regard $ S _ 4 $ as the rotaions of a cube to its self.

A cube has at least one tetrahedron inside of itself as the above picture.<br>
It means it exactly includes $ A _ 4 $ visibly.

Then go back to Aut( $ A _ 4 $ ) .<br>
Aut ( $ A _ 4 $ ) include $ A _ 4 $ itself as Int( $ A _ 4 $ ).<br>
Aut ( $ A _ 4 $ ) consists of 24 elements, and $ A _ 4 $ has 12. <br>
So there is the other 12 elements, which we call Out( $ A _ 4 $ ).

Out( $ A _ 4 $ ) is consists of members which is not $ A _ 4 $, e.g. a mirror projection can map $ A _ 4 $ to itself.<br>

In the above picture `z` $ \in $ $ S _ 4 $ and we can produce a mirror projection from `z`;

` ι(z)(-) = z * - * z` $ {} ^ {-1} $

z is 180 rotation and ι(z) is a mirror projection about xy-plain!
(Note the above picture is quite misleading. ι(z) is not xz-plain reflection. )
If you rotate 180 degree with z axix fixed, then some operation and again rotate 180 degree with z fixed. It generates exactly its mirrored operation!

As the same way, this `ι(-)` maps other elements of $ S _ 4 \setminus A _ 4 $ to Out( $ A _ 4 $ ). And this function is an isomorphism between $ S _ 4 $ and Aut( $ A _ 4 $ ).





# Dihedral groups $D_n$ are also interesting.


There is interesting facts;
~~~
    Int(D3) == Aut(D3)
    Int(D5) !=  Aut(D5)
~~~

assume 'a' is a (360˚/n) clockwise rotation and 'b' is a 180˚flipping rotation
then consider Automorphism in the same way;
~~~
    b |-> b, ba, ... , ba^{n-1}  (n patterns)
~~~

then
~~~
    a |-> ?
~~~

since every member of Int(D5) is described as a D5 member,
the codomain is clockwise or anti-clockwise (not a 180˚flipping rotation because of homomorphism).

~~~
Int(D5)
    72˚ -> 72˚  (a |-> a)    (anti-clockwise -> anti-clockwise),
    72˚ -> -72˚ (a |-> aaaa) (anti-clockwise -> clockwise)

Aut(D5)
    72˚ -> 72˚,
    72˚ -> 144˚,  (a |-> aa)  (anti-clockwise -> butterfly-shape)
    72˚ -> -144˚, (a |-> aaa) (anti-clockwise -> (anti)butterfly-shape)
    72˚ -> -72˚
~~~

so,
~~~
    |Int(D5)| = |Aut(D5)| / 2
~~~

why not compare D3, D5, D7 ?
~~~
1 * |Int(D3)| = |Aut(D3)|
2 * |Int(D5)| = |Aut(D5)|
3 * |Int(D7)| = |Aut(D7)|
~~~

more generally,
~~~
Aut(Dn) = n * φ(n)
where φ(n) denotes Euler's number
~~~



# Galois


The difference between $ D3 $  and $ D5 $ is<br>
extended to $ A _ 5 $ $ \sim $ $ G( T _ {20} ) $ $ \sim $ $ G( T _ {12} ) $

As $ Aut( D _ 5 ) $ contains Butterfly-shape, <br>
$ Aut( A _ 5 ) $ contains more complex-shape that is not included in A5 itself.

So the structure of $ Aut( A _ 5 ) $ cause that we cannot solve algebraic quintic equation.
