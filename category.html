    <h1 class="post-title"> Category Theory </h1><br>

    Categories are difficult for computers to instantly describe its structure composed of various dimensions of arrows. Indeed there are many examples with much eraborations, using tools such as tikz/Tex or etc. <br>
    I would like to choose the way with hand-writing categories.<br>
    So it sometimes does not seem formal, but I will do my best.<br>
    The more urgent thing is, currently I think as a carpenter/architect, to get familiar with categories, which will be achieved with pencil and papers or degital alternatives like apple pencils.<br>
    Category theory is, needless to say, always studied or learned through <a href='http://www.ncatlab.org'>nLab</a>.<br>
    Under Construction. <br><br>
