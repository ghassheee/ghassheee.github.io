# Topology

Topology is a bad concept.<br>
Open set is how open ?<br>
Topology is not generalized concept.<br>
It is unmatured and undeveloped concept.<br><br>

How it will be if we can use (+) operator on Real Number,<br>
but we cannot use it on Natural Number ?<br>
Topology is so bad concept that it can not be built on Natural Number well.<br>


# New definitions of topology

Currently, I am interpreting what grothedieck said about it.<br>
Needless to say, we need backgrounds of category theory.<br>
We can check 3 words.<br>

- grothendieck topology
- frame
- locale


# Glossary

~~~
A topological space X is sober
    if its points are exactly determined by its lattice of open subsets.
~~~


~~~
lattice : a poset which admits all finite meets and finite joins (or all finite products and finite coproducts, regarding a poset as a category (a (0,1)-category)).

A lattice can also be defined as an algebraic structure, with the binary operations ∧
 and ∨ and the constants ⊤ and ⊥.
