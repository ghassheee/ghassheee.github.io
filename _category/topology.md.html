# Topology

Topology is a bad concept.<br>
Open set is how open ?<br>
Topology is not generalized concept.<br>
It is unmatured and undeveloped concept.<br><br>

How it will be if we can use (+) operator on Real Number,<br>
but we cannot use it on Natural Number ?<br>
Topology is so bad concept that it can not be built on Natural Number well.<br>


# New definitions of topology

Grothendieck extract the instict structure of topology as the Grothendieck Topology $J$.
With a category consisting a poset $\mathscr{C}$ and $J$, we construct a Grothendieck Sheaf as a pair $(\mathscr{C}, J)$ which is equivalent to a presheaf $\mathscr{E}$ over $\mathscr{C}$.

There are three keywords to see contemporary topology.

- grothendieck topology
- frame
- locale

A locale is a topological space and a locale homomorphism is a continuous function of topological spaces.
A frame is a morphism in the category of opensets $\mathscr{O}_X$ over a topological space $X$.
A frame morphism is the pullback of a corresponding locale homomorphism.
Thus the category of locales $Loc$ and the cateogry of frames $Frm$ compose a duality.


# Presheaf Topos

What Grothendieck has made is a generalization of topological space.
We can handle discrete spaces ( simplicial complexes ) in the same way.
Presheaf over the category of simplex is called simplicial set $sSet$ and it is the very field of this new topology.
They can be glued and can be devided in a coherent way to discrete topological spaces.

What old topology could not do is, thus, generalised by geniouses, especially Grothendieck and Lurie.



# Glossary

## Sober
~~~
A topological space X is sober
    if its points are exactly determined by its lattice of open subsets.
~~~


## Lattice
~~~
lattice : a poset which admits all finite meets and finite joins (or all finite products and finite coproducts,
    regarding a poset as a category (a (0,1)-category)).

A lattice can also be defined as an algebraic structure, with the binary operations ∧
 and ∨ and the constants ⊤ and ⊥.
