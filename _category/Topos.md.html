## topos and LEM





## Topos as Variety

The Category of Varieties $ \mathscr{Bar} $

- varieties: p,q,r, (p,q), (p,r), (q,r), (p,q,r), ....
- morphisms: inclusion maps, projection maps, ...


~~~
`a variety` means `a set of irreducible varieties` i.e. `a set of prime ideals`

`a program` is `a path in a variety`


~~~



## Topos as Set of rules

- set of rules: {p}, {q}, {r}, {p,q}, {p,r}, {q,r}, {p,q,r}, ...
- morphisms: inclusion maps, projection maps
    - inclusion map:
    - projection map: injectiveness is assured. f:{p,q} -> p

~~~
`a set of rules` means `a programming language`

`a derivation tree` in it means `a program` in that

the path of `a derivation tree` is `a program`
~~~
