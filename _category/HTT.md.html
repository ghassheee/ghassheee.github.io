# Introduction

## The load to Higher Topos Theory


[Leinster]

* we might be able to learn The Basics of Category Theory with this book.

[Kashiwara / Shapira] Categories and Sheaves

* To see Cisinski, the computation of Limits and Kan-extensions are essential.
* Computation of Limits / Colimits are worth checking, which might lead to Section 4.2 of HTT

[玉木] 広がりゆくトポロジーの世界

* This is a convenient way of seeing the Homotopy Calculus in Japanese

[Cisinski] Homotopical Algebra and Higher Categories

* Starts with the Theory of Presheaves
* The power of Yoneda lemma
* Then see the concrete example, simplicial Sets.
* The nerve and realization is an adjunction
* Over the way, it establishes ∞-category.
* The Basics of Model Categories ( Abstraction and the Concrete Examples)



## HTT

* Chapter I : Introduction
* Chapter II : ∞-categories
* Chapter III : ∞-Cat
* Chapter IV : ∞-Category Theory (i.e. Limits Computation / Kan Extenstions)
* Chapter V : ∞-Topoi
* Chapter VI : Higher Topos Theory
* Chapter VII : Topology


Chapter I-III is the introduction to ∞-Categories <br>
Chapter IV is the Computation Technique ( like in Kashiwara Schapira ) <br>
Chapter V, VI is the extension to Topos theory <br>
Chapter VII seems to try How to recapture the topology in terms of HTT  <br>
