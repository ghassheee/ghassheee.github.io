# Model Theory

## what is model theory ?

~~~
model theory = universal algebra + logic        (Chang & Keisler (1990))
model theory = algebraic geometry − fields      (Wilfrid Hodges (1997))
~~~

## e.g.

The standard signature of rings is
$ σ _ {ring} $ = {×,+,−,0,1},

where

- ×, + : binary
- − : unary
- 0, 1 : nullary

The standard signature of semirings is
$ σ _ {smr} $ = {×,+,0,1},

where the arities are as above.

The standard signature of groups (with multiplicative notation) is
$ σ _ grp $ = {×,−1,1},

where

- × is binary,
- −1 is unary and 1 is nullary.

The standard signature of monoids is $ σ _ {mnd} $ = {×,1}.

A ring is a $ σ _ {ring} $ -structure which satisfies the identities

- u + (v + w) = (u + v) + w,
- u + v = v + u,
- u + 0 = u,
- u + (−u) = 0,
- u × (v × w) = (u × v) × w,
- u × 1 = u, 1 × u = u,
- u × (v + w) = (u × v) + (u × w) and (v + w) × u = (v × u) + (w × u).

A group is a $ σ _ {grp} $ -structure which satisfies the identities

- u × (v × w) = (u × v) × w,
- u × 1 = u, 1 × u = u,
- u × $ u ^ {−1} $ = 1 and $ u ^ {−1} $ × u = 1.

A monoid is a $ σ _ {mnd} $ -structure which satisfies the identities

- u × (v × w) = (u × v) × w,
- u × 1 = u and 1 × u = u.

A semigroup is a {×}-structure which satisfies the identity

- u × (v × w) = (u × v) × w.

A magma is just a {×}-structure.
