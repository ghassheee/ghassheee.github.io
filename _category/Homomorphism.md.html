# Group Homomorphisms

They are obvious.

# Ring Homomorphisms

A ring homomorphism $ \phi $ must satisfy

- $\phi (g*h) = \phi (g) * \phi (h)$
- $\phi (g+h) = \phi (g) + \phi (h)$
- $\phi (1) = 1$

The third condition make the homomorphism more strict.

examples (Non trivial)

- $ \mathbb{C} $ homomorphism ( $ z \mapsto z^n $ ) are ring homomorphisms.


# Rng Homomorphisms

A rng homomorphism $ \phi $ is a ring homomorphism without `i` (identity law)

- $\phi (g*h) = \phi (g) * \phi (h)$
- $\phi (g+h) = \phi (g) + \phi (h)$

# Rig Homomorphism

A rig is a ring without `n` (additive negation `-`)
e.g. Natural Numbers $\mathbb{N}$ is a rig.
A rig homomorphism is the same with ring homomorphism except they do not have negation.

- $\phi (g*h) = \phi (g) * \phi (h)$
- $\phi (g+h) = \phi (g) + \phi (h)$
- $\phi (1) = 1$
