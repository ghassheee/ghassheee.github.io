# Group Homomorphisms

They are obvious.

# Ring Homomorphisms

A ring homomorphism $ \phi $ must satisfy

- $ \phi (gh) = \phi (g) \phi (h) $
- $ \phi (g+h) = \phi (g) + \phi (h) $
- $ \phi (1) = 1 $

The third condition make the homomorphism more strict.

examples (Non trivial)

- $ \mathbb{C} $ homomorphism ( $ z \mapsto z^n $ ) are ring homomorphisms.
