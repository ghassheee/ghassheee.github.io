Denotational Semantics are based on the notion of the "state machine"


Axiomatic semantics

- Robert Floyd
- C. A. R. Hoare

Atests a program by focusing on
how the values of variables change as a program executes

- side effects are disallowed in expressions
- the goto command is difficult to specify
- aliasing is not allowed
- scope rules are difficult to describe unless unless we require all identifier names to be unique

predicate logic

we use an applied predicate logic
we view expressions such as “2*n+1” and “x+y>0” as terms in the predicate logic


assertion

An assertion is a logical formula
