# Homotopy Type Theory



deduction

- P â†’ Q (conditional statement)
- P (hypothesis stated)
- Q (conclusion deduced)

- a inhabitant of a type : a proposition



- set theory : first order logic & an axiom on it
- type theory : non

- set theory : set & proposition
- type theory : type

_          | set theory                           | type theory
-----------|--------------------------------------|-------------
foundation | first order logic<br> an axiom on it | non
_          | set & proposition                    | type
_          | "a $ \in $ A" (proposition)          | "a:A" judgment
 equality  | a proposition                        | a type


### deductive type system

- a deductive system : **rules** for deriving things **judgment**

- a judgment "proposition A has a proof"
- a rule "from A and B infer A $ \land $ B"

### type theory

- a judgment "a:A"    ("a" in proposition A is "a witness to the provability of A" or "an evidence that A is true")


"let a:A" is a atomic statement in type theory

- equality in set theory : a proposition
- equality in type theory : a type

"a,b : A" means we have a type "a =A b" called "a and b is propositionally equal"


an equality judgment

- "judgment equality" "a $ \equiv $ b : A"

- "equality" is "a conclusion of the deductive system of a type theory "



Group

- judgements : elements of a Group
- rules : operation
- judgements equality : equality of elements of a Group

context : generator




### some note references

- contextual categories
- categories with families
- comprehension categories [Lurie]
- type-theoritic fibration categories [Shulman 2015]

- categorical description of "logical relations" [Hermida, 1933]

~~~
A |- B : Type               fibration B -> A
A |- \Sigma_B C : Type      composition C -> B -> A
A |- \Pi
