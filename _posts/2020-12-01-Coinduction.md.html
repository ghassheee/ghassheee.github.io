# Coinduction


## Coinduction can handles

* Circular Objects
* Infinite Objects

e.g.

* Real Number
* Stream
* a process that continuously accepts interactions
* the set of possible configurations of some program



## Constructive Math

Coinduction is important in constructive math.

In constructive math, the limitaion on the use of negation have led to the introduction of coinductive tools
to reason on concepts that in classical math are studied as the complements of inductive concepts.


Topology

* Classical Math : closed sets are defined as the complements of open sets
* Constructive Math : closed sets are defined as sets satisfying certain closure Properties


Lambda Calculus

* Classical Math : the set of divergent terms is defined as the complement of the inductive set of convergent terms
* Constructive Math : divergent terms are defined when one find the way of describing the meaning of divergence


## Bisimulation

The `bisimulation equality` called `bisimilarity` is the most studied form of behavioural equality for processes.
