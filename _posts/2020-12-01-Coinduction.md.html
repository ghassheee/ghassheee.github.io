# Coinduction


## Coinduction can handles

* Circular Objects
* Infinite Objects

e.g.

* Real Number
* Stream
* a process that continuously accepts interactions
* the set of possible configurations of some program



## Constructive Math

Coinduction is important in constructive math.

In constructive math, the limitaion on the use of negation have led to the introduction of coinductive tools
to reason on concepts that in classical math are studied as the complements of inductive concepts.


Topology

* Classical Math : closed sets are defined as the complements of open sets
* Constructive Math : closed sets are defined as sets satisfying certain closure Properties


Lambda Calculus

* Classical Math : the set of divergent terms is defined as the complement of the inductive set of convergent terms
* Constructive Math : divergent terms are defined when one find the way of describing the meaning of divergence


## Bisimulation

The `bisimulation equality` called `bisimilarity` is the most studied form of behavioural equality for processes.


* the finest extensional behaviral equivalence (~~ Judgmental Equalities)
    * extensional property of processes: defined being only taken into acount the interactions that the processes may, or may not, perform
* bisimulation proof method (~~ Propositional Equalities)

* efficiency of the algorithm for bisimilarity := minimizse the state-space of prosseses


## Refernces

* [R. Milnor / M. Tofte] Co-induction in relational semantics : soundness of type systems



## Complete Lattice

We explain what coinduction is , using `complete lattice`.

Complete Lattice is `dualisable` , reversing order-relation can make another


## the outline

1. bisimulation and bisimularity
2. bisimulation proof method
3. common process operators : algebraic characterisation of bisimularity
4. bisimilarity os relaxed : weak bisimilarity
5. 6. beavioural equivalences of processes


* `testing equivalence` := two processes are deemed equal unless there is an experiment, or a test, that can separate them




## glossaries

Relation R is

* reflexive
* symmetric
* transitive
* irreflexive
* antisymmetric := xRy and yRx => x=y
* total := forall x,y, xRy or yRx holds
* equivalence := reflexive + symmetric + transitive
* total order := antisymmetric + transitive + total
* partial order := reflexive + antisymmetric + transitive
* preorder := reflexive + transitive
* well-founded := there no infinite descending chains : `...RxR...RbRa`
    * ( Type_i : Type_(i+1) is NOT descending chain )




extensional equality := no observation can distinguish this equality
