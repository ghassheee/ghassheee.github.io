# Whitespace


Example:

~~~
`a + b` is interpreted as a+b ( Here a is a local variable)
`a  +b` is interpreted as a(+b) ( Here a is a method call)
~~~


- Ruby identifiers are case sensitive.
- Ruby identifier names may consist of alphanumeric characters and the underscore character ( _ ).

# Ruby BEGIN/END Statement


Syntax:
~~~
BEGIN {
   code
}

END {
   code
}
~~~

Example:
~~~
#!/usr/bin/ruby

puts "This is main Ruby Program"
END {
   puts "Terminating Ruby Program"
}
BEGIN {
   puts "Initializing Ruby Program"
}
~~~

result:
~~~
Initializing Ruby Program
This is main Ruby Program
Terminating Ruby Program
~~~

# Comments `#`, `=bigin`/`=end`

~~~
# I am a comment. Just ignore me.

name = "Madisetti" # This is again comment
~~~

~~~
# This is a comment.
# This is a comment, too.
~~~

another form.
~~~
=begin
This is a comment.
This is a comment, too.
=end

# Variables

Variables are the memory locations which hold any data to be used by any program.

There are five types of variables supported by Ruby. You already have gone through a small description of these variables in previous chapter as well. These five types of variables are explained in this chapter.

## Global Variables:

Global variables begin with $. Uninitialized global variables have the value nil and produce warnings with the -w option.

Assignment to global variables alters global status. It is not recommended to use global variables. They make programs cryptic.

Here is an example showing usage of global variable.
~~~
#!/usr/bin/ruby

$global_variable = 10
class Class1
  def print_global
     puts "Global variable in Class1 is #$global_variable"
  end
end
class Class2
  def print_global
     puts "Global variable in Class2 is #$global_variable"
  end
end

class1obj = Class1.new
class1obj.print_global
class2obj = Class2.new
class2obj.print_global
~~~

Here `$global_variable` is a global variable. This will produce the following result:

NOTE: In Ruby you CAN access value of any variable or constant by putting a hash (#) character just before that variable or constant.

Global variable in Class1 is 10
Global variable in Class2 is 10
Ruby Instance Variables:
Instance variables begin with @. Uninitialized instance variables have the value nil and produce warnings with the -w option.

Here is an example showing usage of Instance Variables.
~~~
#!/usr/bin/ruby

class Customer
   def initialize(id, name, addr)
      @cust_id=id
      @cust_name=name
      @cust_addr=addr
   end
   def display_details()
      puts "Customer id #@cust_id"
      puts "Customer name #@cust_name"
      puts "Customer address #@cust_addr"
    end
end

# Create Objects
cust1=Customer.new("1", "John", "Wisdom Apartments, Ludhiya")
cust2=Customer.new("2", "Poul", "New Empire road, Khandala")

# Call Methods
cust1.display_details()
cust2.display_details()
~~~

Here, @cust_id, @cust_name and @cust_addr are instance variables. This will produce the following result:

~~~
Customer id 1
Customer name John
Customer address Wisdom Apartments, Ludhiya
Customer id 2
Customer name Poul
Customer address New Empire road, Khandala
~~~

## Class Variables:

Class variables begin with @@ and must be initialized before they can be used in method definitions.

Referencing an uninitialized class variable produces an error. Class variables are shared among descendants of the class or module in which the class variables are defined.

Overriding class variables produce warnings with the -w option.

Here is an example showing usage of class variable:
~~~
#!/usr/bin/ruby

class Customer
   @@no_of_customers=0
   def initialize(id, name, addr)
      @cust_id=id
      @cust_name=name
      @cust_addr=addr
   end
   def display_details()
      puts "Customer id #@cust_id"
      puts "Customer name #@cust_name"
      puts "Customer address #@cust_addr"
    end
    def total_no_of_customers()
       @@no_of_customers += 1
       puts "Total number of customers: #@@no_of_customers"
    end
end

# Create Objects
cust1=Customer.new("1", "John", "Wisdom Apartments, Ludhiya")
cust2=Customer.new("2", "Poul", "New Empire road, Khandala")

# Call Methods
cust1.total_no_of_customers()
cust2.total_no_of_customers()
~~~

Here @@no_of_customers is a class variable. This will produce the following result:
~~~
Total number of customers: 1
Total number of customers: 2
~~~

## Local Variables:

Local variables begin with a lowercase letter or _.



## Ruby Constants:

Constants begin with an uppercase letter. Constants defined within a class or module can be accessed from within that class or module, and those defined outside a class or module can be accessed globally.

Constants may not be defined within methods. Referencing an uninitialized constant produces an error. Making an assignment to a constant that is already initialized produces a warning.

~~~
#!/usr/bin/ruby

class Example
   VAR1 = 100
   VAR2 = 200
   def show
       puts "Value of first Constant is #{VAR1}"
       puts "Value of second Constant is #{VAR2}"
   end
end

# Create Objects
object=Example.new()
object.show
~~~

Here VAR1 and VAR2 are constant. This will produce the following result:
~~~
Value of first Constant is 100
Value of second Constant is 200
~~~


## Pseudo-Variables:

They are special variables that have the appearance of local variables but behave like constants. You can not assign any value to these variables.

- self: The receiver object of the current method.
- true: Value representing true.
- false: Value representing false.
- nil: Value representing undefined.
- __FILE__: The name of the current source file.
- __LINE__: The current line number in the source file.

# Basic Literals:

The rules Ruby uses for literals are simple and intuitive. This section explains all basic Ruby Literals.

## Integer Numbers:
Ruby supports integer numbers. An integer number can range from -230 to 230-1 or -262 to 262-1. Integers with-in this range are objects of class Fixnum and integers outside this range are stored in objects of class Bignum.

You write integers using an optional leading sign, an optional base indicator (0 for octal, 0x for hex, or 0b for binary), followed by a string of digits in the appropriate base. Underscore characters are ignored in the digit string.

You can also get the integer value corresponding to an ASCII character or escape sequence by preceding it with a question mark.

Example:
~~~
123                  # Fixnum decimal
1_234                # Fixnum decimal with underline
-500                 # Negative Fixnum
0377                 # octal
0xff                 # hexadecimal
0b1011               # binary
?a                   # character code for 'a'
?\n                  # code for a newline (0x0a)
12345678901234567890 # Bignum
~~~

NOTE: Class and Objects are explained in a separate chapter of this tutorial.

## Floating Numbers:
Ruby supports integer numbers. They are also numbers but with decimals. Floating-point numbers are objects of class Float and can be any of the following:

Example:
~~~
123.4                # floating point value
1.0e6                # scientific notation
4E20                 # dot not required
4e+20                # sign before exponential
~~~

## String Literals

Ruby strings are simply sequences of 8-bit bytes and they are objects of class String. Double-quoted strings allow substitution and backslash notation but single-quoted strings don't allow substitution and allow backslash notation only for \\ and \'

Example:
~~~
#!/usr/bin/ruby -w

puts 'escape using "\\"';
puts 'That\'s right';
~~~

result:
~~~
escape using "\"
That's right
~~~

You can substitute the value of any Ruby expression into a string using the sequence #{ expr }. Here, expr could be any ruby expression.

~~~
#!/usr/bin/ruby -w

puts "Multiplication Value : #{24*60*60}";
~~~

This will produce the following result:
~~~
Multiplication Value : 86400
~~~

## Backslash Notations:

Following is the list of Backslash notations supported by Ruby:
~~~
Notation	Character represented
\n	Newline (0x0a)
\r	Carriage return (0x0d)
\f	Formfeed (0x0c)
\b	Backspace (0x08)
\a	Bell (0x07)
\e	Escape (0x1b)
\s	Space (0x20)
\nnn	Octal notation (n being 0-7)
\xnn	Hexadecimal notation (n being 0-9, a-f, or A-F)
\cx, \C-x	Control-x
\M-x	Meta-x (c | 0x80)
\M-\C-x	Meta-Control-x
\x	Character x
~~~



## Arrays

e.g.
~~~
#!/usr/bin/ruby

ary = [  "fred", 10, 3.14, "This is a string", "last element", ]
ary.each do |i|
   puts i
end
~~~

result:
~~~
fred
10
3.14
This is a string
last element
~~~


## Hashes (key/value pairs)

e.g.
~~~
#!/usr/bin/ruby

hsh = colors = { "red" => 0xf00, "green" => 0x0f0, "blue" => 0x00f }
hsh.each do |key, value|
   print key, " is ", value, "\n"
end
~~~

result:
~~~
green is 240
red is 3840
blue is 15
~~~


## Ranges

- (1..5) : it includes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 .
- (1...5) : it includes 1, 2, 3, 4 .

e.g.
~~~
#!/usr/bin/ruby

(10..15).each do |n|
   print n, ' '
end
~~~

result:
~~~
10 11 12 13 14 15
~~~
