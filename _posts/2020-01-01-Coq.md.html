# How to Load Library in Coq

1. compile library with `-Q` option
~~~
coqc -Q cpdtlib Cpdt ./cpdtlib/CpdtTactic.v
~~~

2. run coqtop with `-Q` option
~~~
coqtop -Q ./cpdtlib Cpdt
~~~






# CPDT


## Why Coq ?

There are proof assistants

- ACL2
- Coq
- Isabelle/HOL
- PVS
- Twelf


### susbset types : i.e. topos type : normal type refined by a predicate

PVS << Coq

### Dependent types enable certified programs without writing proof like programs

???


### De Bruijn Criterion


~~~
de Bruijn Criterion :
    Some proof assistants generate proof objects
    that can be checked independently from the System
    by a simple program that a skeptical user can write
~~~


- ACL2 : ×
- Coq : ○
- Isabelle/HOL : ○
- PVS : △
- Twelf : ?


### Automation

- Twelf : ×
- the rest : ○


### Certified Decision Procidures

e.g. proof by reflection

## Why not a new DT language ?

- Coq is well developped systems for tactic-based theorem provers
- e.g. Compiler Correctness proof , the term in `proof : Prop` is not obvious and readable one.
- in such case, automation is so useful. (Do not write proof directly.)


## Design Pattern of proof assistants

This book shouw "Design Pattern" which is accomplished with

- dependently typed functions
- custom `Ltac` decision procedures
