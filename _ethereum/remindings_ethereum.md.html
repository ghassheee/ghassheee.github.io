When the price of Bitcoin rose above 10 billion dollar, in the autumn of 2013,
I started to research what it is technically. Then I was not interested in it since it is mere money. Since I was a carpenter, I thought that I was not the man who decentralize central banks, and the thought was still until I saw vitalik talks about ethereum on youtube in the beginning of 2014.

At spring 2014, I was watching the development of ethereum community, through gitter channel or twitter. There was ~ 20 people I remember now.

@VitalikButerin : python developer
@gavofyork : c++ developer (maybe @subtly)
@jeffehh : Go chief developer and Rich Experienced Programmer
@peter_szilagyi : Go hard developper
@fxlange : Go clever developper

and many others like
