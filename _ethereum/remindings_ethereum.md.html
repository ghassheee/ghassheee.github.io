When the price of Bitcoin rose above 10 billion dollar, in the autumn of 2013,
I started to research what it is technically. Then I was not interested in it since it is mere money. Since I was a carpenter, I thought that I was not the man who decentralize central banks, and the thought was still until I saw vitalik talks about ethereum on youtube in the beginning of 2014.

At spring 2014, I was watching the development of ethereum community, through gitter channel or twitter. There was ~ 20 people I remember now.

@VitalikButerin :   python developer
@gavofyork :        c++ developer (maybe @subtly)
@jeffehh :          Go chief developer and Rich Experienced Programmer
@peter_szilagyi :   Go hard developper
@fxlange :          Go clever developper

and many others like

@stephanTual :      COO
@jutta_steiner :    mathematician

@VladZamfir         PoS Researcher
@lefterisJP
@mandeleil          Java Developer

and so many ...


At the summer of 2014, the core team launched the cloud funding based on Bitcoin Network.
I imagined there might be situations as ..

~~~
Vitalik wrote Python code as the first idea,
Gavin interpreted it with c++ and
Jeff pointed out some reality of machine codes with Go.
~~~

At the summer of 2015,
Mainnet launched triggered with Bitcoin Network.


By the end of 2016,
it seems that

@nicksdjohnson joined and made up "ENS" (former google chief developer)
Vitalik joined the study group of @zcash team
