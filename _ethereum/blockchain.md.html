# Blockchain No.12

## scriptless script on schnorr

This technique enables for a musician to send a music on blockchain,
with each time they make a schnorr signature.

## MAST

Merklized Abstract Syntax Tree enables partitioning of contract code and sharded storing of codes.

Each separated child script returns True to the parent script.


## Bitcoin

~~~
- FlyClient (extended spv : super light client)
    - SPV client : only all blockheader
    - using a technique, 'Merkle Mountain Range'
- Graphene (minimize the time taken for block propagation to 10% of CompactBlock)
    - using Bloom filter and IBLT
        - Bloom filter enables spv wallet to judge my transaction is included in a block
        - IBLT enables to reconsile data pool called mempool
    - former version: Xtreme Thinblock
        - BUIP010
        - Sharing 'memory pool (mempool)' stops duplication of including the same transactions in different blocks
- Bobtail(minimize the variaty of block time )
    - 80% of blocktimes are in [1 min, 24 min]
- Microchain(smart phone full node)

- Bolt(completely Private payment channel) : we cannot detect who is sender, or receiver
- ValueShuffle(CoinJoin + Confidential Transaction)
    - CoinJoin : use a mixed list of fresh addresses
    - ValuShuffle apply Confidential Transaction to Coinjoin


- Discreet log Contract DLC
    - using Schnorr signature and smart contracts, this solves the oracle problem
    - oracle problem
        - 2of2 multisig can cause a deadlock of deposit
        - 2of3 multisig is preferable
        - this third party 'oracle' can have a risk to be bought by one side.

- scriptless script
    - run script without putting script on the chain


- XCAT(cross chain atomic swap trade)

- radio broadcasted bitcoin transactions
~~~


## Devcon(Ethereum)

~~~
- sharding : 2 universe
    - main
    - sub sharding network
- casper : POS
    - FFG : used to move PoW to Pos
    - CBC : consensus management after finishing migration to PoS
- plasma : multiple layer


- Inter Blockchain Communication IBC
    - by Cosmos

- Zero knowledge proof satisfies
    - Completeness
    - Soundness
    - Zero knowledge

- TrueBit
    - make the calculation of smart contract off chain
~~~
