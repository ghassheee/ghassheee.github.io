# From Vitalik's Slide

Uses of cryptography

- Hashes : prove topological (partial) order of messages
- Signatures : prove the identity of the sender of a message
- ZKPs : prove arbitrary computable predicates on messages

- PoW : prove that a certain amount of expected computational effort was expended
- Erasure codes : convert a 100% data availability requirement into a 50% data availability
- Timelock crypto /sequential PoW
- Homomorphic Encryption


Incentives
- Tokens:
    - e.g. block rewards
- Privileges: incentiveze
    - e.g. transaction fees

# Security Words

~~~
You can think of the sensors as the eyes and ears of the internet.
You can think of the actuators as the hands and feet of the internet.
You can think of the stuff in the middle as the brain.



The threats have become greater.

Traditionally, computer security is divided into three categories:
confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

- availability:
    - the degree to which a system suffers degration or interruption
    in its service to the customer as a consequence of failures of one or more of its parts
- confidentiality:
- integrity:


- confidentiality threats: the data is stolen in your computer
- availability threats: computer viruses that delete our data
- integrity threats: hackers who can manipulate data entries can do things ranging from changing grades in a class to changing the amount of money in bank accounts

In France people use why3 to verify compilation into a stack machine. The paper is in French https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01094488/document
