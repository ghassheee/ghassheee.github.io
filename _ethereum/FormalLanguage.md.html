# Todo Type Theory

Before starting, we should get very accustomed to Type Theories.

- Type Theory
- Implement Dependent Type Checker






# Research Todo

## Loops in Typed Blockchain Programming Languages

### What about adding fix to bamboo ?

bamboo by pirapira ( around 2018 version ) analysis : see https://github.com/ghasshee/pen

- Bamboo may not have `fix` operator which can be typed with Infinite Type
- Analyse Code Generator of bamboo


### Coq's Well Foundness

- Coq Style programming Language i.e. forbid increasing recursion
- Requisity of "Well Foundedness" : A set is "Well Founded" if it has a minimum element.




## Type Inference and Dependent Types

- Motivation : To what extent, Type Inference is Practical
    * Let Polymorphism (mono types)
    * System F (poly types)
    * Rank 2 polymorphism

- Dependent Types  v.s.  Type Inference


##

# Gas Leak Checker

point out where Gas is used


A contract say
" If someone send money to this contract,
 then they can withdraw what they sent. "


Borrow checker
This data has life time and when borrowing it, it is locked.

# Assembly

How to lock data

What is the specification of MIR ?



This Contract has a lifetime
if someone



# Error handling

## Formal Contract

Formal Contract cannot have any kind of errors since it has been proved that the code of the contract has no bugs.

## Not Formal Contract ?

if a deployed contract detect a run time error, i.e. it is a contract written by a Non Formal Laguage.

# How to one can know which contract on the blockchain is formal and which is not ?

Byte Code Specification

# Prerequisities

## The Fundamental Base of Type Theory

- Types and Programming Languages
- Advanced Topics in Types and Programming Languages
- Homotopy Type Theory Book (Appendix A)

- Local Type Inference [Pierce 98]



## Papers about blockchain programmings







# What to do


## List EVM Machine Codes
