# mail server on whisper

A mail server functions with storing messages even when a node is offline.

# evm

On EVM, a contract can send Ether to other contracts by executing selfdestruct(target_contract). The receiver target_contract has no way to refuse the transfer. So a contract should be designed to withstand unexpected balance increases.


# disassembler

Porosity will decompile to solidity, but afaik it is missing some opcodes still.

`evmdis` is a disassembler and will make bytecode more readable

## Sending ether

The basic way of sending a simple transaction of ether with the console is as follows:
~~~
> eth.sendTransaction({from:sender, to:receiver, value: amount})
~~~

Using the built-in JavaScript, you can easily set variables to hold these values. For example:
~~~
> var sender = eth.accounts[0];
> var receiver = eth.accounts[1];
> var amount = web3.toWei(0.01, "ether")

## contract address

~~~
The address for an Ethereum contract is deterministically computed from the address of its creator (sender) and how many transactions the creator has sent (nonce). The sender and nonce are RLP encoded and then hashed with Keccak-256.

From pyethereum:

def mk_contract_address(sender, nonce):
    return sha3(rlp.encode([normalize_address(sender), nonce]))[12:]
In Solidity:

nonce0= address(keccak256(0xd6, 0x94, address, 0x80))
nonce1= address(keccak256(0xd6, 0x94, address, 0x01))
Example with some discussion:

For sender 0x6ac7ea33f8831ea9dcc53393aaa88b25a785dbf0, the contract addresses that it will create are the following:

nonce0= "0xcd234a471b72ba2f1ccf0a70fcaba648a5eecd8d"
nonce1= "0x343c43a37d37dff08ae8c4a11544c718abb4fcf8"
nonce2= "0xf778b86fa74e846c4f0a1fbd1335fe81c00a0c91"
nonce3= "0xfffd933a0bc612844eaf0c6fe3e5b8e9b6c1d19c"
