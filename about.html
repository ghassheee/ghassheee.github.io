<h3> GhaSShee </h3>

an Architect .<br><br><br><br>

<h3> Beech Trees </h3>

Beech Tree Forest is a final state of forest state transition.<br>
I think we have to build the ground of the world economy or the foundations of people's life on such a stable state for our, now and in the future, efficiency;<br>
Therefore, we pursue Architecture with Beech forest.<br><br><br><br>

<h3> Mathematics / Category Theory </h3>

Definition is the best tool used for our peace, making rules that everyone is to approve of.<br>
We have to learn Mathematics because we are living together in this world.<br>
When I was a student of Japanese Top Lanked University, I feel that the education of Matrices (Linear Algebra) are made with pencil and papers, which will make the students spoil their time, which means that we need more abstract theory of them.
With Category Theory, we can handle any kind of matrices with understanding of algebra using category.
The furthermore (Formal) Category Theory can be a language because it has varieties which current or past "Set Theory" (sets with functions) does not have.
<br>

If you like mathematics, google below function and set the range as you like.<br>
<code>
((x^2+(y-5)^2-0.55)((x-2)^2+(y-5)^2-0.45)((x-1)^2+((y-5)-sqrt(3))^2-0.5)-1)(((x-5)^2+(y-5)^2-0.5)((x-7)^2+(y-5)^2-0.6)((x-6)^2+((y-5)-sqrt(3))^2-0.4)-1)((x^2+y^2-0.55)((x-2)^2+y^2-0.45)((x-1)^2+(y-sqrt(3))^2-0.5)-1)(((x-5)^2+y^2-0.5)((x-7)^2+y^2-0.6)((x-6)^2+(y-sqrt(3))^2-0.4)-1)(x-3)(y-3)(x+2)(y+2)(x-8)(y-8)
</code>

<h3> Jobs </h3>

I am a licensed house architect.<br>
I worked for 4 years as a carpenter and got a License of House Architect in Japan.
For the reason that there is enough house infrastructure, I thought that comptemporary Architects should consider the development of it with the revolution of Internet Infrastructures and Computer Technologies.
now working on both Computer Architects and House Architects.<br>
My works are sometimes on twitter.<br>
If you need a fantastic furniture, or internet of things,<br>
