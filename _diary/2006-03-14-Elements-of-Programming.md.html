I thought that in context of functional programming,
the book is not worth reading and just a Historical Analysis of OO language, hence not practical one. Only one chapter I read then quit.

2015年に翻訳本として再出版されており図書館で読んでみた。
ものづくりをするような人には、想像の範囲を超えず、抽象化の道をたどるにもかかわらず、
最新の型理論を導入せず、特に意味のないものとなっている。
オブジェクト指向の勉強にもならず、過去の公文書を読むような歴史研究家のための一冊。
「プログラミング原論」1章のみを英語でまとめた。

# Basics

<br>

Here, we will explain these concepts :

* `value`
* `object`
* `type`
* `procedure`
* `regularity`

<br>



## concepts of categology

<br>

### entity


#### entity

* `abstract entity (抽象実体)` : forever existing and immutable
* `concrete entity (具象実体)` : generating and disappearing(annihilating)

#### attribute

* `attribute (属性)`: mapping between `concrete entity` and `abstract entity`

#### identity

* `identity (アイデンティティ)` : give identification of a `concrete entity` even when its `attribute` changes.

#### snapshot

* `snapshot　(スナップショット)` : complete set of `attributes` at a certain moment



「具象実体」は、物理実体だけでなく、法的実体、経済的実体、あるいは政治的実体でもある。
「青」と「13」は抽象実体。
「ソクラテス」と「アメリカ合衆国」は、具象実体。
「ソクラテスの目の色」、「合衆国の州の数」は属性。


<br>

### species


#### species

* `abstract species` : common characteristics in abstract entity such as `color` or `Natural Number`
* `concreate species` : a set of attributions in concrete entity which are equivarent contently such as `Male` or `state in the United States`.


#### function

* function is a rule that maps an abstract entity into another abstarct entity.
* `succ` relates a `Natural Number ` with the next `Natural Number`

<br>

### genus

* `abstract genus 抽象属` : it expresses different `abstract species` which are similar. like `numbers` and `binary operators`
* `concrete genus 具象属` : it expresses different `concrete species` which are similar. like `mammals` or `biped animal`

<br>




## value

<br>

### datum

#### datum

* datum : {0|1}* : finite sequence consists of 0, 1 or both.

#### type

* value type : mappings between species and a set of datum
* pointer type :

#### representaion & interpretation

* representation : the mapped datums with specified entity
* interpretation : the entity with which datums are mapped

<br>

### value

#### value

* value : a datum interpreted with an interpretation


#### well formed

* datum is `well formed` about value type if datum represents abstract entity.
* `NaN(Not a Number)` is not `well formed`

#### properly partial or torall

* `properly partial` : representing corresponding proper subset of abstract entity like `int`
* `total` : representing total set of the abstract entity like `bool`

#### uniquely represented

* value type is `uniquely represented` if value mapping into abstract entity is monomorphism.
* `false; value=0 | true; otherwise` is not `uniquely represented`.

#### umambigious

* value type is `umambigious` if each value has one interpretation.
* value type is `ambigious` if a value has two or more interpretation.

#### equal

* values are `equal` if they are representing the same abstract entity.
* values are `representationally equal` if their representation sequences are the same.




#### lemma :
`equality` is `representational equality` if value type is uniquely represented.

#### lemma :
`representational equality` is `equality` if value type is umambigious.


* the real `behaviral equality` costs very much or is possible to implement.
* it is not possible check whether two different sequence of opcodes are the same computable function.


#### implement

* computer `implement` functions about `abstract entity` as functions about `value`.

#### regular

* a function defined about value type is `regular` if its equality is valid.
* $ numerator $ is a function which takes ( $ a/b : \mathbb{Q} $ ) and returns $ a $
* $ numerator(1/2) \neq numerator(2/4) $ : $ numerator $ is not `regular`.


#### equational reasoning (等式推論)

* regular function enables `equational resoning`.
* that is , it enables replacing its argument with another `equal` argument.



<br>


## Object

<br>

### memory and word

~~~
memory : a sets of words

word : address and content
~~~

#### address and content
~~~
`address` : a value called `address length`

`content` : a value called `word length`
~~~

#### load and store
~~~
load : an operation knowing the content from an address

store : an operation change the content of an address with a content
~~~

<br>

### object

* object is a concrete entity represented as values located in memory.
* object is a collection of `resource`s.
* object resources can be distributed many places or even many computers.
* Here ,we see, object is located in a single address space in a sinle memory.

#### starting address

* every object has its `starting addreess`.

#### object type

* `object type` is a cast making objects in which values are stored.
* all objects belong to some `object type`s.


#### objects and values

* objects and values have complementive role with each others.

in the sense;

* values are immortal
* values are indepent from implemantation in a certain computer
* objects are mortal
* Each object has the implementaion which differs from computer to computer.


* values can be written on paper.
* values can be `serialized` and sended in a network.

#### imperative language and functional language

* imperative language treats `objects`
* functional language treats `values`


#### how to express entity

* `entity` can be expressed by `value`
* a sequece of values can express the sequence of snapshots of a concrete entity

* objects can express concrete entity with mutable values
* objects can express abstract entity with immutable values


#### The reason using Object

1. Objects modelize mutable concrete entities.
2. Objects provides the strong way for implementing functions for values.
3. Computers which have memories are the only thing which can compute everythings.


#### well formed (Object)
* An Object is well-formed if its state is well-formed

#### properly partial (Object)
* An Object is properly paritial if its value is properly partial
* if not , Objects are total

#### uniquely represented (Object)
* An Object Type is uniquely represented if its value types are uniquely represented



<br>

### identity token

concrete entity has idenitity

so, Object has an `identity token`

#### identity token
* `identity token` is a uniquely represented value


#### equality

* Objects are equal iff its states are equal

#### copy

* an Object is a copy of another object if they are equal.

<br>

## Procedure

<br>

### procedure

* procedure : a sequence of operations which modifies the state of an object or objects

#### objects which changed in procedure are classified into 4 groups

1. `input/output` : procedures' returning objects $ \wedge $ objects passed into another procedure
2. `locate state` : objects which generated, destroyed, and , modified in a single call in a procedure.
3. `grobal state` : objects which can be called or can be accessed several times by any procedures.
4. `own state` : objects which are can be accessed by a single procedure (or a set of related procedures) , which can be called several times.



#### directly and indirectly

* an object is passed `directly` if passed as a return object or as an argument.
* an object is passed `indirectly` if passed through a pointer pointing the object.

#### input

* object is `input` for an procedure iff it is read only and not modified.

#### output

* object is `output` from an procedure iff the object has only the last state of the procedure and not initial state or states at some point of the procedure.

#### input/output

* object is `input/output` of a procedure iff it is not only read but also modified in the procedure.

<br>

### basis

#### computational basis

* computational basis for a type : a set of procedures which can express all the procedures of the type

#### efficient

* a basis is `efficient` if a procedure of the basis is as efficient as that of any other basises.

#### expressive

* a basis is `expressive` if it defines procedures which are simple and easy to use.


<br>

## Regular Type

<br>

### regular type

`regular type` : a type having a basis which enables deploy object into a data structure and copy object from a data structure to another one

~~~
type is regular
=================
type has
* equality
* assignment
* destructor
* default constructor
* copy constructor
* total order
* actual type
~~~

<br>

### equality

equality : a procedure which take 2 objects and return bool
~~~
a == b;
a != b;
~~~


<br>

### assignment

assignment : a procedure which take 2 objects and make first object equal to second object without changing the state of second object
~~~
a = b;
~~~

<br>

### destructor

destructor : a procedure which finish the existence of an object

`partially formed` :
* object is `partially formed` if it can be destructed or assigned.

<br>

### default constructor

default constructor : a procedure which take no arguments and generate a `partially formed` object
~~~
T a;
T()    //anonymous object
~~~

<br>

### copy constructor

copy constructor : a procedure which take an argument of a type and create a new and equal object of the same type .

~~~
T b = a;     // make copy of object a
~~~

<br>

## Regular Procedure

regular procedure : a procedure whose argument can be replaced with an equal object and return the same output

<br>

### e.g. not regular procedures

* `addressof()` : a procedure(function) which returns object's address
* a procedure which returns object containing the real world information such as time
* e.g. `rand()` : a procedure which returns object containing information depending on a static state   * a procedure which returns an attribute not depending on the object's representation

<br>

### functional procedure

functional procedure : a regular procedure defined on regular types

e.g. functional procedure
~~~
int plus_0(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}

int plus_1(const int& a, const int& b)
{
    return a + b;
}
~~~

e.g. not functional procedure
~~~
void plus_2(int* a, int* b, int *c)
{
    *c = *a + *b;
}
~~~


### definition space

`difinition space` : an subset of input values for a functional procedure

a functional procedure has complete output for its `definition space`

`homogeneous functional procedure` : its input objects are all of the same type.

domain of homegeneous functional procedure is product of the unique type

domain of non-homogeneous functional procedure is defined separately on each type rather than as product of different types

codomain : return type

result space : a set of all values returned


## Concept

<br>

### Concept

concept : a description of requests for one or more types described by procedures of the types, type attributes, or ,type functions

"Types `model` a concept" if the concept is satisfied by the types

type attribute : T -> value ; a mapping from type into value describing its attribute

e.g. `sizeof(T)`

functionType : T -> T' ; a mapping from type into another type


~~~
concept(T_1, ... ,T_n)
        ::= conceptClause_1
         && ...
         && conceptClause_k

conceptClause
        ::= another concept application
         || all type attributes, all type functions, or all signature of a procefure composing the concept
         || axioms described by these type attributes, type functions, and, procedures
~~~





e.g. the concept of UnaryFunction (F : functional procedure)
~~~
UnaryFunction(F)::=
       FunctionalProcedure(F)
    && Arity(F) == 1
    && Domain : UnaryFunction -> Regular ; F |-> InputType(F,0)


where
    Arity() : number of input arguments
    InputType(F,i) : return type of i-th argument

~~~

e.g. the concept of HomogeneousFunction
~~~
HomogeneousFunction(F)::=
       FunctionalProcedure(F)
    && Arity(F) > 0
    && (forall i, j in Natural Number. i,j < Arity(F) ) => (InputType(F,i) == InputType(F,j))
    && Domain : HomogeneousFunction -> Regular ; F |-> InputType(F,0)
~~~

<br>

### abstract procedure

e.g.
~~~
template<typename Op>
    requires(BinaryOperation(Op))
Domain(Op) square(const Domain(Op)& x, Op op)
{
    return op(x,x);
}
~~~
