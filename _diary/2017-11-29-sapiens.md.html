# The Cognitive Revolution

## An Animal Of No Significance

~~~
In Homo sapience,
the brain accounts for about 2-3 per cent of total body weight,
but it consumes 25 per cent of the body`s energy when the body is at rest.

atrophy : the condition of losing flesh, muscle, strength
flesh : the soft substance between the skin and borns of animals
the skin : the skin of an animal is uniquely connected.
borns : a human has a lot of borns
Their muscles atrophied.

rip : tear sth or become torn, often suddenly or violently
    I ripped my jeans on the fence.
    The ape can rip the man.
rag : a rag doll : a piece of old, torn, cloth used especially for cleaning things
flint : a type of very hard grey stone

What then drove forward the evolution
of the massive human brain during those 2 million years?

locomotion : movement or the ability to move
supple : able to bend and move parts of your body into different positions

Natural selection consequently favoured earlier births.

Humans are born prematurely.

A colt can trot : a young male horse can run
colt : a young make horse
walk < tolt < run(canter)

forage : to search for food
tow : to pull a vehicle with rope
in tow : they are with you and following closely behind

It takes a tribe to raise a human.

furnace : a space surrounded on all sides by walls and a roof
    for heating metal or glass to very high temperatures

devour : to eat all of sth quickly, especially because you are very hungry
giraffe : a tall African animal with a very long neck, long legs
devour a giraffe
You don`t dare interfere with them.
scavenge the leftovers
scavenge : to search through waste or garbage for things that can be used or eaten
leftovers : food that has not been eaten at the end of a meal
As lions became deadlier, so gazelles evolved to run faster.

(p13)

~, which makes us doubly cruel and dangerous.
Many historical calamities, from deadly wars to ecological catasrophes,
have resulted from the over-hasty jump.
calamity : an event that causes great damage to people`s life
overhasty : done too soon, especially without enough thought

charcoal : a black substance made by burning wood slowly in an oven with little air
Foods that humans cannot digest in their natural forms
staples of our diet
staple : a small piece of wire which is used in a stapler
staple : a basic type of food that is used a lot
    My staple is not only rice but also spaghetti.
Whereas chimpanzees spend five hours a day chewing raw food,
a single hour suffice for people eating cooked food.
The advent of cooking : the coming of the event of an invention of `cooking`

(p14)

the shortening of the human intestinal track
intestine : a long tube in the body between the stomach and the anus
Since long intestines and large brains are both massive energy consumers,
it`s hard to have both.
Eagles indentity thermal columns rising from the ground,
spread their giant wings and allow the hot air to lift them upwards.

    only a temporal problem displayed on the ecological radar

(p15)

Sapiens was minding its own business in a corner of Africa

(p16)

Sapiens reached East Asia, they interbred with the local Erectus,
so the Chinese and Koreans are a mixture of Sapiens and Erectus.
interbeed - interbred :
revulsion : a strong feeling of disgust or horror
anatomy : the scientific study of the structure of human or animal bodies
odours : an unpleasant smell
the generic gulf separating the two populations was already unbridgeable.
lineage : the series of families that sb comes from originally
The lineages of all contemporary humans can be traced back, exclusively, to East Africa,
70,000 years ago.

(p17)

It turned out that 1-4 per cent of the unique human DNA of modern populations
in the Middle East and Europe is Neanderthal DNA.
fossilised finger

6 per cent of the unique human DNA of modern Melanesians and Aboriginal Australians
is Denisovan DNA.

(p18)

Homo sapiens drove Denisovans to extinction.
gather the nuts and berries
dwindle : to gradually become less or smaller
Their population dwindled, and they slowly died out,
except perhaps for one or two members who joined their Sapiens neighbours.
conpetition for resources flared up into violence and genocide.
Tolerance is not a Sapiens trademark.
A small difference in skin colour, dialect or religion has been enough
to prompt one group of Sapiens to set about exterminating another group.
prompt A to do : cause A to happen / make A decide to do
prompt : done without delay / immediate
set about : begin
exterminate : to kill all the members of a group of people or animals / (wipe out)

explain to them everything we know
Accidental genetic mutations changed the inner wiring of the brains of Sapiens,
enabling them to think in unprecedented ways and to communicate using an altogether new type of language.
unprecedented : that has never happened

(p24)

inform one another of the whereabouts of food
A parrot can say anithing Albert Einstein could say.

(p25)
She can then describe the exact location
Our language evolved as a way of gossiping.

enable A to do
Fiction enabled us not merely to imagine things, but to do so collectively.
weave - wove - woven : to make a cloth or by crossing threads or strip across, over and under each other by hand
We can weave common myths such as the biblical creation story.
Ants and bees can also work together in huge numbers,
but they do so in a very rigid manner and only wih close relatives.
rigid : very strict and difficult to change

(p28)

Sapiens can cooperate in extremely flexible ways with countless numbers of strangers.
Less benevolently,
he might monopolise particularly coveted foods and prevent lowerranking makes from mating with the females.
benevolent : kind, helpful, and generous

When two males are contesting the alpha position,
they usually do so by forming extensive coalitions of supporters.

(p29)

There are clear limits to the size of groups

troop : soldiers, especially in large groups
prolonged warfare
warfare : the activity of fighting a war, especially using a particular weapon
prolong : to make sth last longer
slaughter : to kill an animal, usually for its meat
Sociological research has shown that the maximum `natural` size of a group bonded by gossip is about 150 individuals.
Even today, a critical threshold in human organisations falls somewhere around this magic number.

(p30)

rumour-mongering
rumour-monger : a person who spread rumours
A platoon of thirty soldiers or even a company of a hundred soldiers can function well on the basis of intimate relations, with a minimum of formal dicipline.
platoon : a small group of soldiers that is part of a company and commanded by a lieutenant
lieutenant : an officer of middle rank in the army, navy, or air force.
second lieutenant / sub lieutenant / flight lieutenant
A well-respected sergeant can become `king of the company` and exercise authority even over commissioned officers.

flourish without a board of directors
The threshold of 150 indivisuals is crossed.
Successful family businesses usually face a crisis when they grow larger and hire more personnel.

Modern lawyers tell far stranger tales.
It`s the hood ornament that adorns vehicles made by Peugeot.

The company owns factories, machinery and showrooms, and employs mechanics, accountants and secretaries, but all these together do not comprise Peugeot.
comprise : 1. consist of / build up

(p32)

ornate : covered with a lot of decorations
He paid a lawyer to go through all these sacred procedures.
Once the lawyer had performed all the right rituals and pronounced all the necessary spells and oaths, millions of upright French citizen behaved as if the Peugeot company really existed.
Much of history revolves around this question.
revolve : to go in a circle around a central point
Just try to imagine how difficult it would have been to create states, or churches, or legal systems if we could speak only about things that really exist, such as rivers, trees and lions.
woven : weave - wove - woven : to make cloths with combining threads
immense : extremely large or great
This alarm conveniently frightened away a fellow monkey who had just found a banana, leaving the liar all alone to steal the prize for itself.
Unlike lying, an imagined reality is something that everyone believes in, an imagined reality is something that everyone believes in, and as long as this communal belief persists, the imagined reality exerts force in the world.
communal : shared by,  or for the use of , a number of people, especially people living together
charlatan : a person who claims to have knowledge or skills which they do not really have

(p35)

Sapiens have thus been living in a dual reality.
In 1789 the French population switched almost overnight from believing in the myth of the divine right of kings to believing in the myth of the sovereignty of the people.
Sapiens soon far outstripped all other human.

Entire herds were butchered annually
erect
artificial traps and slaughtering grounds
If violence broke out between the two species, ~.

(p41)

The immense diversity of imagined realities that Sapiens invented, and the resulting diversity of behaviour patterns, are the main components of what we call `cultures`.
the realm of biology
realm : an area of activity, interest, or knowledge
(p42)

Human culture became exempt from biological laws.
Our physical abilities are still shaped by our DNA

(p44)

As far as we know, the people who carved tha Stadel lion-man some 30,000 years ago had the same physical, emotional and intellectural abilities we have.

What happened in the Cognitive Revolution ?

- The ability to transmit information about the world `surrounding` them.
- The ability to transmit information about their social relationship (resulting groups up to 150)
- The ability to transmit information about what do not really exist such as spirits, nations, companies, and human rights (resulting cooperation between very large numbers of strangers)

Sapiens began to
devote almost all their time and effort to manipulating the lives of a few animal and plant. species
From sunrise to sunset humans sowed seeds, watered plants, plucked weeds from the ground
and led sheep to prime pastures.

Wheat and goats were domesticated by approximately 9000 BC;
peas and lentils around 8000 BC;
olive trees by 5000 BC;
horses by 4000 BC;
grapevines in 3500 BC.
Camels and cashew nuts were domesticated even later.

maize : a tall plant grown for its large yellow grains that are eaten as a vegetable
millet : a type of plant whose seeds are used mainly for making flour
flour : a fine white or brown powder made from grain, especially wheat,
    and used in cooking for making bread, cakes, etc.
barley : a plant grown for its grain used for making food, beer, and whisky
China`s first revolutionaries domesticated rice, millet and pigs.
Northi America`s first gardeners were those who got tired of combing the undergrouth
for edible gourds and decided to cultivate pumpkins.
New Guineans tamed sugar cane and bananas,
while the first West African farmers made African millet, African rice, sorghum and wheat
conform to their needs.
conform : to bahave and think in the same way as most people in a group or society
sorghum : very small grain grown as food in toropical countries
truffle : an expensive type of fungus that grows underground, used in cooking
fungus - fungi : mashrooms and mildew are both fungi
ferocious : very aggresive or violent

(p89)

Scholars once proclaimed that
the agricultural revolution was a great leap forward for humanity.
Eventually, people were so smart that they were able to decipher nature`s secret,
enabling them to tame sheep and cultivate wheet.
As soon as this happened, they cheerfully abandoned
the gruelling, dangerous and often spartan life of hunter-gatherers,
settling down to enjoy the pleasant, satiated life of farmers.

gruel : a simple dish made by boiling oats in milk or water
gruel(l)ing : very difficult and tiring, needing great effort for a long time
spartan life : a simple or severe life which lacks anything that make it easier
satiated life : a life that is full of what to do and they can not do any other things
satiate : to give sb so much of sth that they do not feel they want any more
Rather than heralding a new era of easy living,
the Agricultural Revolutions left farmers with lives generally more difficult
and less satisfying than those of foragers.

(p90)

The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind,
but the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure.
Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites.
culprit : a person who has done sth wrong or against the law
culprit : a person or thing responsible for causing a problem
These plants domesticated Homo sapiens, rather than vice versa.
How did this grass turn from insignificant to ubiquitous ?
Wheat did it by manipulating Homo sapiens to its advantage.
Within a couple of millennia,
humans in many parts of the world were doing little from dawn to dusk
other than taking care of wheat plants.

(p91)

Sapiens broke their backs clearing fields.
Wheat was attacked by rabbits and locust swarms,
so the farmers built fences and stood guard over the fields.
locust : a large insect that lives in hot countries and flies in large groups
swarm : a large group of insects, especially moving together in the same direction
Wheat was thirsty, so human dug irrigation canals or lugged heavy buckets from the well to water it.
thirsty : needing or wanting to drink
dug - dig : remove an amount of soil from the ground to get deeper or make a hole
irrigation :
irrigate : to supply water to an area of land through pipes or canals so that crops will grow

Studies of ancient skeletons indicate that
the transition to agriculture brought about a plethora of ailments,
such as slipped discs, arthritis and hernias.
arthritis : a disease that cause a pain or swelling in one or more joints of the body
The `domesticate ` comes from the Latin `domus`, which means `house`.
Remember, humans are omnivorous apes who thrive on a wide variety of foods.
omnivorous : having wide interests in a particular area or activity
peasant

(p92)

Peasants died by the thousands.


(p93)

Many anthropological and archaeological studies indicate that
in simple agricultural societies with no political frameworks beyond village and tribe,
human violence was responsible for about 15 per cent of deaths,
including 25 per cent of male death.
In contemporary New Guinea,
violence accounts for 30 per cent of male deaths.
In time,
human violence was brought under control through the development of larger social frameworks
- cities, kingdom and states.
But it took thousands of years to build such huge and effective political structures.
Yet for the average person,
the disadvantages probably outweighed the advantages.

affluence : ( syn : prosperity )
malnutrition : a poor condition of health caused by a lack of food or a lack of the right type of food

but in 2,000 years, people will have plenty to eat and live in big air-conditioned houses,
so my suffering is a worthwhile sacrifice ?
bestow : to give sth to sb to show how much they are respected
Cultivating wheat provided much more food per unit of territory,
and thereby enabled Homo sapiens to multiply exponentially.

Wild plants gave way to wheat fields.
cramp : a sudden pain you get when the muscles in a particular part of your body contradict,
usually caused by cold or too much exercise
The currency of evolution is neither hunger nor pain.
currency : the fact that sth is used or accepted by a lot of people
Just as the economic success of a company is measured only by the number of dollars
So the evolutionary success of a species is measured by the number of copies of its DNA.
Why would any sae person lower his or her standard of living
just to multiple the number of copies of the Homo sapiens genome ?

No sinle step separated the woman gathering wild wheat from the woman farming domesticated wheat,
so it`s hard to say exactly when the decisive transition to agriculture took place.
But by 8500 BC, the Middle East was peppered with permanent villages.

Babies were weaned at an earlier age.
wean : to gradually stop feeding a baby or a young animal with its mother`s milk

Every generation continued to live like the previous generation, making only small improvements here and there in the way things were done.
Paradoxically, a series of `improvements`, each of which was meant to make life easier,
added up to a milestone around the necks of these farmers.
(added up to a eraborate burden around the necks of these farmers)
millstone : one of two flat stones used to crush grains
People were unable to fathom the full consequences of their decisions.

Then they begin to count on it.
Finally they reach a point where they can`n live without it.
Rather than writing the first thing that came into their heads,

Stonehenge dates to 2500 BC, and was built by a developed agricultural society.
The structures at Goebekli Tepe are dated to about 9500 BC,
and all available evidence indicates that they were built by hunter-gatherers.
unilitarian
The only way to build Goebekli Tepe was for thousands of foragers belonging to different bands and tribes to cooperate over an extended period of time.
Only a sophisticated religious or ideological system could sustain such efforts.
Goebekli Tepe held another sensational secret.

(p102)

In order to feed the people who built and used the monumental structures,
particularly large quantities of food were required.
It may well be that foragers switched from gathering wild wheat to intense wheat cultivation,
not to increase their normal food supply,
but rather to support buildings and running of a temple.
intense : very great; very strong
When it prospered, they were happy.
prosper : to develop in a successful way
The Faustian bargain between human and grains was not the only deal our species made.
Faustian : an agreement in which sb agrees to do sth bad or dishonest
Another deal was struck concerning the fate of animals such as sheep, goats, pigss and chickens.
Normadic bands that stalked sheep gradually altered the constituions of the herds on which they preyed.
prey : an animal, bird .. that is hunted, killed and eaten by another
This process probably began with selective hunting.
Humans learned that it was to their advantage to hunt only adult rams and old or sick sheep.
corralled the herd into a narrow gorge
corral : a fenced area for hourses, sheep, etc.
corral : to force horses or cows into a corral

Today the world contains about a billion sheep, a billion pigs, more than a billion cattle, and more than 25 billion chickens.
From a narrow evolutionary perspective,
which measures success by the number of DNA copies, the Agricultural Revolution was a wonderful boon for chickens, cattle, pigs and sheep.
boon : something that is very helpful and makes life easier for you
fowl : a bird that is kept for its meat and eggs
From a narrow evolutionary perspective which measures success by the number of DNA copies,
the Agricultural Revolution was a wonderful boon for chickens, cattle, pigs and sheep.

(p105)

The domestication of animals was founded on a series of brutal practives that only became crueller with the passing of the centuries.
brutal : violent and cruel
slaughter : kill an animal, usually for its meat
In contrast, the vast majority of domesticated chickens and cattle are slaughtered
at the age of between a few weeks and a few months,
because this has always been the optimal slaughtering age from an economic perspective.
But the price of the long life of fowl is subjugation to a way of life completely alien to their urges and desires.
It`s reasonable to assume, for example, that bulls prefer to spend their days wandering ovr open prairies in the company of other bulls and cows rather than pulling carts and ploughshares
under the yoke of a whip-wielding ape.
prairy
ploughshares : (a machine which ploughe lands shared and pulled by cows ? )

their natural instincts and social ties had to be broken,
their aggression and sexuality contained, and their freedom of movement curtailed.

The process of taming almost always involves the castration of males.
castrate : to remove the testicles of a male animal or person
testicle : either of two ball-shaped organs that produce sperms

To ensure that the pigs can`t run away, farmers in northern New Guinea slice off a chunk of each pig`s nose.
This causes severe pain whenever the pig tries to sniff.
Since the pigs cannot find food or even find their way around without sniffing,
this mutilation makes them completely dependent on their human owners.
It has been customary to gouge out pigs` eyes, so that they cannot see where they`re going.
gouge : to make a hole or cut in sth with a sharp object in a rough or violent way
gorge : a narrow valley
calf : 1. the back part of the leg between the ankle and the knee

prick       : to make a very small hole in sth with a sharp point
puncture    : to make a small hole in sth
gouge       : to make a hole in sth with a sharp object
Tuareg camel breeders in the Sahara used to puncture or cut off parts of the nose and upper lip of young camels in order to make suckling painful, thereby discouraging them from consuming too much milk.
Shepherds and farmers throughout history showed affection for their animals and have taken great care of them,
just as many slaveholders felt affection and concern for their slaves.

The Agricultural Rebolution was terrible catastrophe.
Their evolutionary `success` is meaningless.
a rare wild rhinoceros on the brink of extinction
on the brink of extinction / collapse / war / death / disaster
brink : if you are in the brink of sth, you are almost in a new, dangerous, or exciting situation.
The contented rhinoceros is no less content for being amoung the last of its kind.
The numerical success of the calf`s species is little consolation for the suffering the individual endures.
(The numerical success of the calf`s species do not help the suffering individual endures.)
contented - content : to accept and be satisfied with sth and not have or do sth better
consolation : a thing or person that make you feel better when you are unhappy or unsatisfied
This discrepancy between evolutionary success and individual suffering is perhaps the most important lesson
we can draw from the Agricultural Revolution.
In the following chapters we will see time and again how a dramatic increase in the collective power
and ostensible success of our species went hand in hand with much individual suffering.
hand in hand : if two people are hand in hand, they are holding each other`s hand
hand in hand : if two things go hand in hand, they are closely connected and one thing cause the other

greed : a strong desire for wealth, possesions, power, etc. than a person need
By the 1st century AD, only 1-2 million foragers remained (mainly in Australia, America),
but their numbers were dwarfed by the world`s 250 farmers.
dwarf : a creature like a small man, who has magic powers and who is described as living and working under the ground, especially working with metal
dwarf : to make sth small or unimportant compared with sth else
    The old houses were dwarfed by the huge new tower blocks.
turf : short grass and the surface layer of soil that is held together by its root.
turf : an area in which sb lives around

Henceforth, attachment to `myhouse` and separation from the neighbours became the phychological hallmark of a much more self-centred creature.
They laboriously carved out of the surrounding wilds.
They cut down forests, dug canals, cleared fields, built houses, ploughed furrows,
and planted fruit trees in tidy rows.
furrow : a long narrow cut in the ground, especially one made by a plough for planting seeds

Forager discounted the future because they lived from hand to mouth and could only preserve food or accumulate possessions with difficulty.
Social alliances and political rivalries were long-term affairs.
It often took years to reply a favour or to average a wrong.
Nevertheless, in the subsistence economy of hunting and gathering,
there was an obvious limit to such long-term planning.
Paradoxically, it saved foragers a lot of anxieties.
There was no sense in worrying about things that they could not infuence.
Farmers must always keep the future in mind.

(p113)

Concern about the future was rooted not only in teh seasonal cycles of production,
but also in the fundamental uncertainty of agriculture.
They were at the mercy of droughts, floods and pestilence.
pestilence : any infectious disease that spreads quickly and kills a lot of people

The anxious peasant was as frenetic and hard-working as a harvester ant in the summer,
sweating to plant olive trees whose oil would be pressed by his children and grandchildren.
frenetic : involing a lot of energy and activity in a way that is not organized

(p114)

The stress of farming had far-reaching consequences.
It was the foundation of large-scale political and social systems.
Sadly, the deligent peasants almost almost never achived the future economic security they so craved
through their hard work in the present.
crave A : to have a very strong desire for sth / long for
greed : a strong desire for wealth more that a person needs
from cradle to grave
The extra they produced fed the tiny minority of elites
- kings, government officials, soldiers, priests, artists and thinkers - who fill the history books.
The food surpluses enabled more and more people to cram together first into large villeges, then into towns, and finally into cities, all of them joined together by new kingdoms and commercial networks.
cram : to push or force sb/sth into a small space
And if no agreement can be reached, strife spreads, even if the storehouses are bulging.

(p115)

Yogoslavia still disintegrated into a terrible bloodbath.
calamity : an event that causes greatt damage to people`s lives, property, etc.
The handful of millennia separating the Agricultural Revolution from the appearance of cities,
kingdoms and empires was not enough time to allow an instinct for mass cooperation to evolve.
Despite the lack of such biological instinces, during the foraging era,
hundreds of strangers were able to cooperate thanks to their shared myths.
However, this cooperation was loose and limited.
mythology
While human evolution was crawling at its usual snail`s pace,
the human imagination was building astouding networks of mass cooperation.
snail : a small soft creature a hard shell on its back, that moves very slowly, some of them can be eaten
at its usual snail`s pace
astounding : surprising / shocking
astound : (syn: astonish) to surprise or shock sb very much

(p116)

sprout
sway  : to move slowly from side to side
pharaoh
In 221 the Qin dynasty united China
dynasty : the series of rulers of a country who all belong to the same family
the Mediterranean basin
basin (washbasin) : a large round bowl for hoding liquid
Tax levied.
levy : an extra amount of money that has to be paid, especially as a tax to the govenment
Qin subjects : people who is subobedient with Qin / people who have the right to belong Qin country
bureaucracy : the system of official rules and ways of doing things that a government
or an organization has, especially when these seem to be too complicated
at its zenith
subject : a person who has right to belong the country, especially of one king or queen
therres and amphitheatres
amphitheatre : a round building without a roof and with rows of seats that rise in steps in an open space
harbour rosy illusions
harbour : to hide or protect sb who is hiding from police
`Cooperation` sounds very altruistic.
Most human cooperation networks have beed geared towards oppression and expoitation.
oppress : to treet sb in an unfair way, especially by not giving them the same freedom, or rights as other people
burgeoning cooperation network
burgeon : to begin to grow or develop rapidly

(p117)
vicous gladiatorial combat
vicous : violent and cruel
gladiatorial - gladiator : an entertainer trained to fight other men/animals in public
All these cooperation networks were `imagined orders`.
How can myths sustain entier empires ?
We have already discussed one such example: Peugeot.
Next let`s examine two of the best known myths of history:
`the Code of Hammurabi of 1776 BC` and `the American Declaration of Independence of 1776 AD`

(p118)
judicial decisions
judicial : connected with a court, a judge ,..
    judicial powers

(p119)
Future generations took notice.
Elite canonised the text, and apprentice scribes countinued to copy it long after Hammurabi died.
canonise : to state officially that sb is now a saint
saint : a person churches recognized as being very holy
apprentice : a young person who works for an employer for a fixed period of time in order to learn particular skills needed for their jobs

(p120)
The principle of hierarchy is of paramount importance.
According to the code, people are divided into two genders and three classes:
superior people, commoners and slaves.
A female commoner is worth 30 silver shekels.
A slave woman is worth 20 silver shekels.
A male commoner is worth 60 silver shekels.

(p122)
retort : reply quickly to a comment, in an angry, offended or humorous way
Hammurabi and the American Founding Fathers alike imagined a reality
governed by universal and immutable principles of justice, such as equality or hierarchy.
a figment of the imagination : no stretch of the imagination
The idea of equality is inextrecably intertwined with the idea of creation.
Every person has a divinely created soul.
`Created equal` should therefore be translated into `evolved differently`.

(p123)
Birds fly not because they have a right to fly, but ~.
The ostrich is a bird that lost its ability to fly.
So `unalienable rights` should be translated into `mutable characteristics`.
Humans in democratic societies are free.
Humans in dictatorships are unfree.

The lines from the American Declaration of Independence translated into biologiical terms:

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men evolved differently,
that thery are born with certain mutable characteristics,
and that amoung these are life and the pursuit of pleasure.

Adovocates of equality
advocate A : support A publicly

(p124)
Imagined orders are not evil conspiracies or useless mirages
conspiracy : a secret plan by a group of people to do sth harmful or illegal
mirage : an effect caused by hot air in deserts or on roads, that makes you think you see sth, such as water, which is not there

It`s likely that more that a few readers squirmed in their chairs while reading the preceding paragraphs.
squirm : to move around a lot making small twisting movements, because you are nervous, unconfortable
    The children were squirming restlessly in their seats.
Voltaire said about God that `Ther is no God, but don`t tell that to my servant, lest he muder me at night`.
Do not A, lest B : if A happened, then B.
A natual order is a stable order.
In contrast, an imagined order is always in danger of collapse.
Because the myths vanish once people stop believing it.

(p125)
If an ancient Babylonian blinded his neighbor, ~.
regime :
Prince Tallerrand, who began his chameleon like carrer under Luis XVI,
later served the revolutionary and Napoleonic regimes,
and switched loyalities in time to end his days working for the restored monarchy,
summed up decades of government experience by saying that
`You can do many thins with bayonets, but it is rather uncomfortable to sit on them`
bayonet : a long sharp knife that is fastened onto the end of a rifle and used as a weapon in a battle
fasten : to close and join together two parts of sth
It is impossible to organise an army solely by coercion.
coercion : the action that makes sb do what they do not want to do, using forces or threatening to use forces
The elite may do so out of cynical greed.
cynical : behaving that person only do things to help themselves rather than good or honest reasons
cynic : a person who think that people are cynical

(p126)
Diogence, the Greek philosopher
bishops and priests
bishop : a senior priest
The modern economic system would not have lasted a sinle day if the majority of investors and bankers failed d to believe in caitalism.
Free markets are the best economic system, not because Adam Smith said so,
but because these are the immutable laws of nature.

(p127)
working-class attire
attire : clothes
    dressed in formal evening attire
No young nobleman would have worn a peasant`s smock
worn - wear
smock : a loose comfortable piece of clothing like a long shirt, worn especially by women
Back then,
to be addressed as `Sir` or `Madam` was a rare privilege reserved for the nobility,
and often purchased with blood.
Today all polite correspondence, regardless of the recipient, begins with `Dear Sir or Madam`.
How the imagined order is woven into the tapestry of life?
weave - woven
~~~

~~~
Three main factors prevent people from realising that the order organising their lives exists only in their imagination:

a. The imagined order is embedded in the matirial world.
    In modern architecture, this myth leaps out of the imaginatino to take shape in store and mortar.
    The ideal modern house is devided into many small rooms
    so that each child can have a private space, hidden from view, providing maximum autonomy.
    This private room almost invariably has a door, and in many households it is accepted practice for the child to close,
    and perhaps lock, the door.
b. The imagined order shapes our desire.
    Our personal defires thereby become the imagined order`s most importand defences.
    the most cherished desires
    cherish A : to love A very much
    Friends giving advice often tell each other, `Follow your heart.`
    But the heart is a double agent that usually takes its instructions from the dominant myths of the day.
    The very recommendation to `follow your heart` was implanted in our minds
    by a combination of 19th-century Romantic myths and 20th-century consumerist myths.
    The Coca-Cola Company, for example, has marketed Diet Coke.
    The elite of ancient Egypt spent their fortunes building pyramids and having their corpses mummified,
    but none of them thought of going shopping in Babylone or taking a skiing holidays in Phoenicia.
    People today spend a great deal of money on holidays abroad because they are true belivers in the myths of romantic consumerism.
    The marriage of Romanticism and consumerism has given birth to the infinite `market of experience`
    widen
    ardent : enthuastic and showing strong feelings about sth
    Romanticism tells us that ~.
c. The imagined order is inter-subjective.
    1. An object phenomenon exists independenly of human consciousness and human beliefs.
    Radioactivity, for example, is not a myth.
    While she did not believe that radioactivity could kill her,
    she nevertherless died of aplastic anaemia, a disease caused by overexposure to radioactive materials
    overexposure to radioactive materials
    2. The subjective exists depending on consciousness and belief of a single individual.
    3. The iner-subjective is something that exists within the communication network
    linking the subjective consciousness of may individuals.
    If a sinle individual changes his or her beliefs, or even dies, it is of little importance.
    charade : a situation in which people pretend that sth is true when it clearly is not
    Many of history`s most important drivers are inter-subjective: law, money, gods, nations
    If Peugeot`s CEO alone were suddenly to stop believing in Peugeot`s existence,
    he`d quickly land in the nearest mental hospital and someone else whould occupy his office.
    So in order to change them we must simultaneously change the consciousness of billions of people, which is not easy.
    It follows that in order to change an existing imagined order,
    we must first believe in an alternative imagined order.
    dismantle : take apart a machine or a structure
        I had to dismantle the engine in order to repair it.
    mantle : to cover the surface of
    There is no way out of the imagined order.
    When we break down our prison walls and run towards freedom,
    we are in fact running into the more spacious exercise yard of a bigger prison.

Evolution did not endow humans with the ability to play football.
True, it produced legs for kicking, elbows for fouling and mouths for crusing,
but that all that this enables us to do is perhaps practise penalty kicks by ourselves.
ritualise
endow :
foul :
cruse :
Puppies throughout the world have the rules for rough-and-tumble play hard-wired into their genes.
tumble : to fall downwards, often hitting the ground many times, but usually without serious damages
ritualise : to do sth in the same way or pattern every time
hard-wired : built into pernanent system and not provided by software
hard-wired : (of a skill) present when you are born and not changed in your life
hard-wired into their genes

(p135)

Ants and bees are resilient because most of the information needed to sustain them is encoded in the genome.
A female honeybee larva can, for example, grow up to be either a queen or a worker,
depending on what food it is fed.
Researchers have failed to locate lawyer bees.
The queen does not cheat the cleaner bees of their food,
and they never go on strike demanding higher wages.
But humans do such things all the time.
Because the Sapiens social order is imagined,
humans cannot preserve the critical information for running it simply by making copies of their DNA
and passing these on their prgeny.
decree : an official order from a ruler or a government that becomes the law

(136)

mnemonist :
mnemonic : a word, sentence, poem that helps you to remember sth
transcend : to be or go beyound the usual limits of sth (syn : exceed)
    There is a limit that even master mnemonists cannot transcend.
remedy : a way of dealing with or improving unpleasant or difficult situation

In order to tax millions of people, it was imperatibe to collect data about people`s incomes and possessions.
arrears : the money that sb owes that they have not paid at the right time (つけ)
    arrears, debts and fines
exemption : official permission not to do sth or pay sth that you would normally have to do or pay
most human brais overdosed or fell asleep
constrained the size
Sumerian, who lived in southern Mesopotamia, geniuses invented a system for storing and processing information outside their brains,
one that was custom-built to handle large amounts of mathematical data.
The Sumerians thereby release their socil ordr from the limitations of the human brain.
The data-processing system invented by the Sumerians is called `writing`.

(p138)

clay tablet
There were signs for 1,10,60,600,3600 and 36,000.
The Sumerians used a combination of base-6 and base-10 numeral system.
Their base-6 system bestowed on us several important legacies,
such as the division of the day into 24 hours and of the circle into 360 degrees.
By combining both types of signs the Sumerians were able to preserve far more data than any human brain could remember or any DNA chain could encode.
barley : a plant grown for its grain used for making food, beer and shiskey
probable : likely to happen
Alas, ~. : (exclamation) How sad it is that ~.
apprentice : a young person working for a fixed period of time to learn skills they use.

(p139)

Latin Script, ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and Braille are full scripts, and not partial scirpt.
Partial script is a system of material signs that can represent only particular types of information,
belonging to a limited field of activity.
It didn`t disturb the Sumerians that their script was ill-suited for writing poetry.
Andean script was written by tying knots on colourful cords called quipus.

(p140)

Thanks to quipus, the Incas could save and process large amounts of data,
without which they would not have been able to maintain the complex administrative machinery that an empire of that size requires.

(p141)
When Spaniards came to Inca,
the problem was that the Spaniards did not themselves know how to record and read quipus,
making them dependent on local professionals.
The continent`s new rulers relalised that this placed them in a tenuous position -
the native quipu experts could mislead and cheat their overlords.
undecipherable :
Very few quipus survived the Spanish occupation, and most of those remaining are undecipherable, since, unfortunately, the art of reading qupus has been lost.
cuneiform : an ancient system of writing used in Persia and Assyria.
exalt : to make sb rise to a higher rank or position, sometimes to one that they not deserve
deserve : if sb/sth deserve A, it is right for sb/sth to have A, because of the way they have behaved or because of what they are
dramas, prophecies and cookbooks
prophecy : a statement that will happen in the future, especially one made by sb with magic powers or religious
ream : a large quantity of writing
realm : an area of activity, interest, or knowledge
prerogative : a right or advantage belonging to a particular person or group because of their importance or social position

(p142)

But tax registries and complex bureaucracies were born together with partial script,
and the two remain inexorably linked to this day like Samese twins.
inexorable : that cannot be stopped or changed
think of the cryptic entries in computerised databases
instantaneously : happening immediately
We all know that the brain`s retrieval system is amazingly efficient,
except when you are trying to remember where you put your car keys.
How are trying to remember where you put  your car keys.
How, though, do you find and retrieve information stored on quipu cords or clay tablets?
retort : reply quickly at an angry or offensive attitude
    She retorted that it was my fault as much as hers.
grumble : complain about sth/sb in a bad-tempered way

(p144)

Even if he finds it, how will he be able to cross-check to ensure that
the one from thirty years ago is the latest document relating to the field in question?
cross-check : both your dealing partner and you check
double-check : you check twice
Data processing requires
methods of organisation like catalogues
methods of reproduction like photocopy machines,
methods of rapid and accurate retrieval like computer algorithms and
pedantic librarian who know how to use these tools
pedantic : too worried about small details or rules
What set apart Sumer is that these cultures developed good techniques of archiving, cataloguing
and retrieving written records.
cane : the hard hollow of stem of some plants
cane : these stems used to make furniture such as chairs
cane : a piece of cane or a thin stick
cane : a piece of cane or a thin stick used to help sb to walk
cane : to hit a child with a cane
Ancient scribes learned to usd catalogues, dictionaries, forms and tables.
spouse : a husband or wife

compartmentalise : to devide sth into seperate sections, especially one thing does not affect the other

(p147)
anew : (adv) if A does B anew, A does it again from the beginning or does it in a different way
Crucial parts of Mathematical process take place not in the head, but inside computers or on classroom blackboards.
