    <h1 class="post-title"> AVM </h1><br>

    Architecture be an instance of AVM which is integrated into Architectural Grobal Virtual Machine.<br><br><br>

    <h2>The concept</h2><br>

    Whoever defined as a person has two legs and two hands and one head?<br>
    Some person could happen not to have two legs, but three legs. <br>
    Joan Milo draws a picture of a person with strange legs. <br>
    It might be a miracle that we usually have two legs.<br>

    Therefore, we must be careful when we construct a house.<br>
    It should be much more miracle one. <br>
    This is the starting point of contemporary Architecture.<br>
    Poles or Walls can happen to move as its dweller wants.<br>
    This is our starting point of the view.<br><br>
