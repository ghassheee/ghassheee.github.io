# grep

## why GNU grep is fast

1. grep AVOIDS LOOKING AT EVERY INPUT BYTE.
2. grep EXECUTES VERY FEW INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH BYTE


$ Boyer-Moore $ algorithm

1. looks for the final letter of the target string,
2. uses a lookup table to tell it how far ahead it can skip in the input whenever it finds a non-matching character.


GNU grep also unrolls the inner loop of Boyer-Moore,
and sets up the Boyer-Moore delta table entries
in such a way that it doesn't need to do the loop exit test at every unrolled step.
The result of this is that, in the limit,
GNU grep averages fewer than 3 x86 instructions executed for each input byte it actually looks at (and it skips many bytes entirely).

See ["Fast String Searching"](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.13.9460&rep=rep1&type=pdf),
by Andrew Hume and Daniel Sunday,
in the November 1991

you also need fast input.

GNU grep uses raw Unix input system calls and avoids copying data after reading it.

Moreover, GNU grep AVOIDS BREAKING THE INPUT INTO LINES.
Looking for newlines would slow grep down by a factor of several times,
because to find the newlines it would have to look at every byte!

So instead of using line-oriented input, GNU grep reads raw data into
a large buffer, searches the buffer using Boyer-Moore, and only when
it finds a match does it go and look for the bounding newlines.
(Certain command line options like -n disable this optimization.)



GNU grep makes the *kernel* avoid handling every byte of the input,
by using mmap() instead of read() for file input.

using read() caused most Unix versions to do extra copying.
Since GNU grep passed out of my hands, it appears that use of mmap became non-default, but you
can still get it via --mmap.  And at least in cases where the data
is already file system buffer caches, mmap is still faster:

~~~
  $ time sh -c 'find . -type f -print | xargs grep -l 123456789abcdef'
  real	0m1.530s
  user	0m0.230s
  sys	0m1.357s
  $ time sh -c 'find . -type f -print | xargs grep --mmap -l 123456789abcdef'
  real	0m1.201s
  user	0m0.330s
  sys	0m0.929s
~~~


## Summary:

- Use Boyer-Moore (and unroll its inner loop a few times).

- Roll your own unbuffered input using raw system calls.  Avoid copying
  the input bytes before searching them.  (Do, however, use buffered
  *output*.  The normal grep scenario is that the amount of output is
  small compared to the amount of input, so the overhead of output
  buffer copying is small, while savings due to avoiding many small
  unbuffered writes can be large.)

- Don't look for newlines in the input until after you've found a match.

- Try to set things up (page-aligned buffers, page-sized read chunks,
  optionally use mmap) so the kernel can ALSO avoid copying the bytes.
