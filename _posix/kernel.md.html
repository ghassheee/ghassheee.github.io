## CPU flags

~~~
How can I tell whether my processor has a particular feature? (64-bit instruction set, hardware-assisted virtualization, cryptographic accelerators, etc.) I know that the file /proc/cpuinfo contains this information, in the flags line, but what do all these cryptic abbreviations mean?

For example, given the following extract from /proc/cpuinfo, do I have a 64-bit CPU? Do I have hardware virtualization?

model name      : Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     E8400  @ 3.00GHz
…
flags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat pse36 clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss ht tm pbe syscall nx lm constant_tsc arch_perfmon pebs bts rep_good aperfmperf pni dtes64 monitor ds_cpl vmx smx est tm2 ssse3 cx16 xtpr pdcm sse4_1 lahf_lm tpr_shadow vnmi flexpriority

x86

(32-bit a.k.a. i386–i686 and 64-bit a.k.a. amd64. In other words, your workstation, laptop or server.)

FAQ: Do I have…

* 64-bit (x86_64/AMD64/Intel64)? lm
* Hardware virtualization (VMX/AMD-V)? vmx (Intel), svm (AMD)
* Accelerated AES (AES-NI)? aes
* TXT (TPM)? smx
* a hypervisor (announced as such)? hypervisor

Most of the other features are only of interest to compiler or kernel authors.

All the flags

The full listing is in the kernel source, in the file arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h.

P.S. This listing was derived from arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeature.h in the kernel source. The flags are listed in the same order as the source code. Please help by adding links to descriptions of features when they're missing, by writing a short description of features that have an unexpressive names, and by updating the list for new kernel versions. The current list is from Linux 4.15-rc7.

ARM

On ARM processors, a few features are mentioned in the features: line. Only features directly related to the ARM architecture are mentioned there, not features specific to a silicon manufacturer or system-on-chip.

The features are obtained from looking up the CPU id with read_cpuid() and looking it up in the processor type definitions known at compile time where the features are expressed as a mask of HWCAP_xxx flags. The corresponding strings are in hwcap_str etc. in setup.c.

In the list below, ARMv6 introduced SIMD instructions and datatypes. ARMv7 provided Advanced SIMD instructions and datatypes. On 32-bit ARM machines, neon signals Advanced SIMD; while asimd signals Advanced SIMD on 64-bit arm machines.

swp: SWP instruction (atomic read-modify-write)
half: Half-word loads and stores
thumb: Thumb (16-bit instruction set)
26bit: "26 Bit" Model (Processor status register folded into program counter)
fastmult: 32×32→64-bit multiplication
fpa: Floating point accelerator
vfp: VFP (early SIMD vector floating point instructions)
edsp: DSP extensions (the 'e' variant of the ARM9 CPUs, and all others above)
java: Jazelle (Java bytecode accelerator)
iwmmxt: SIMD instructions similar to Intel MMX
crunch: MaverickCrunch coprocessor (if kernel support enabled)
thumbee: ThumbEE
neon: Advanced SIMD/NEON (asimd on AArch64 older kernels)
vfpv3: VFP version 3
vfpv3d16: VFP version 3 with 16 D-registers
tls: TLS register
vfpv4: VFP version 4 with fast context switching
idiva: SDIV and UDIV hardware division in ARM mode
idivt: SDIV and UDIV hardware division in Thumb mode
vfpd32: VFP with 32 D-registers
lpae: Large Physical Address Extension (>4GB physical memory on 32-bit architecture)
evtstrm: kernel event stream using generic architected timer
aes: hardware-accelerated AES (secret-key cryptography)
pmull{2}: 64×64→128-bit F2m multiplication — acceleration for the GCM mode of authenticated encryption
sha1: hardware-accelerated SHA-1
sha2: hardware-accelerated SHA-256
crc32: hardware-accelerated CRC-32
Beyond that, the Hardware: line indicates the processor model. Depending on the model, there may be other information in other files under /proc or /sys, or in boot-time kernel log messages. Unfortunately each ARM CPU manufacturer has its own method for reporting processor features, if any.

Or alternatively you can use cpuid program, it must be in debian repository. It dumps every possible info about your CPU with some explanations, so you don't get those obscure flags.

cpuid expands the abbreviations. I wouldn't really call its output explanations. Knowing that ht means “Hyper Threading” explains it to some extent, but knowing that mmx means “MMX instruction set”, not so much, and that mca means “Machine Check Architecture”, hardly. – Gilles May 22 '14 at 18:10

@Gilles ...and yet, "Machine Check Architecture" is certainly better Google query than "mca" ;) – Alois Mahdal Jun 6 '14 at 10:07

x86

Find it yourself in 4.1.3 x86 and the Intel manual

arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeature.h contains the full list.

The define values are of type:

X*32 + Y
E.g.:

#define X86_FEATURE_FPU     ( 0*32+ 0) /* Onboard FPU */
The features flags, extracted from CPUID, are stored inside the:

__u32 x86_capability[NCAPINTS + NBUGINTS]; field
of struct cpuinfo_x86 boot_cpu_data
defined at x86/kernel/setup.c
which is initialized through __init functions.

Where each x86_capability array element comes from:

| index | eax      | ecx | output | file        |
|-------|----------|-----|--------|-------------|
|     0 |        1 |   0 | edx    | common.c    |
|     1 | 80000001 |     | edx    | common.c    |
|     2 | 80860001 |     | edx    | transmeta.c |
|     3 |          |     |        |             |
|     4 |        1 |   0 | ecx    | common.c    |
|     5 | C0000001 |     | edx    | centaur.c   |
|     6 | 80000001 |     | ecx    | common.c    |
|     7 |          |     |        | scattered.c |
|     8 |          |     |        |             |
|     9 |        7 |   0 | ebx    | common.c    |
|    10 |        D |   1 | eax    | common.c    |
|    11 |        F |   0 | edx    | common.c    |
|    12 |        F |   1 | edx    | common.c    |
Notes:

empty entries mean: "from various places" or "not available"
index: is the index of x86_capability, e.g. x86_capability[0]
eax and exc: are the input values for CPUID in hex. Inputs that use exc, which are fewer, call it the subleaf (of a 2 level tree with eax at the root).
output: is the register from which CPUID output is taken
file: is the file where those fields are defined. Paths are relative to arch/x86/kernel/cpu/.
transmeta: was the name of a CPU vendor https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmeta that was acquired by Novafora https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/novafora
centaur: was the name of a CPU vendor https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_Technology that was acquired by VIA https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIA_Technologies. Cyrix is another one.
Conclusions:

most entries come directly from CPUID output registers and are set in common.c by something like:

c->x86_capability[0] = edx;
Those are easy to find in batch on the Intel manual for CPUID.
the others are scattered throughout the source, and are set bit by bit with set_cpu_cap.

To find them, use git grep X86_FEATURE_XXX inside arch/x86.

You can usually deduce what CPUID bit they correspond to from the surrounding code.
Other fun facts

The flags are actually printed at arch/x86/kernel/cpu/proc.c with the code:

seq_puts(m, "flags\t\t:");
for (i = 0; i < 32*NCAPINTS; i++)
    if (cpu_has(c, i) && x86_cap_flags[i] != NULL)
        seq_printf(m, " %s", x86_cap_flags[i]);
Where:

cpu_has does the main check for the feature.
x86_cap_flags[i] contains strings that correspond to each flags.
This gets passed as a callback to the proc system setup. The entry point is at fs/proc/cpuinfo.c.
x86_cap_flags strings are generated by arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mkcapflags.h directly from arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeature.h by "parsing" it with sed...

The output goes to arch/x86/kernel/cpu/capflags.c of the build directory, and resulting array looks like:

const char * const x86_cap_flags[NCAPINTS*32] = {
    [X86_FEATURE_FPU]        = "fpu",
    [X86_FEATURE_VME]        = "vme",
so for example X86_FEATURE_FPU corresponds to the string "fpu" and so on.
cpu_has breaks down into two cases with code:

#define cpu_has(c, bit)                         \
    (__builtin_constant_p(bit) && REQUIRED_MASK_BIT_SET(bit) ? 1 :  \
    test_cpu_cap(c, bit))
They are:
__builtin_constant_p(bit) && REQUIRED_MASK_BIT_SET(bit): the flag is required for the kernel to run.

This is determined by data inside required-features.h, which comments:

Define minimum CPUID feature set for kernel These bits are checked
really early to actually display a visible error message before the
kernel dies.  Make sure to assign features to the proper mask!
Since those are known at compile time (kernel requirements), have already been checked at startup, the check can be resolved at compile time if bit is known at compile time.

Thus the __builtin_constant_p(bit) which checks if bit is a compile time constant.
test_cpu_cap: this uses up CPUID data from the struct cpuinfo_x86 boot_cpu_data global

## Interupt 割り込み

kernel is dealing with many computations ,such as loop.
External Input signal by keyboards or networks reach kernel .
How kernel deal with this kind of signals is called "Interruption".

kernel はループ処理をはじめとして、さまざまな計算処理を処理している
そこに、キーボードやネットワークからの入力がある。
これを割り込みという。

Linux :
「ソフト割り込み」
