`free`: Display amount of free and used memory
~~~sh
free
        total       used        free        shared      buff/cache  available
Mem:    16G         2G          1G          1G          13G         14G

- `total`: Total installed memory
- `used`: `total` - `free` - `buff` - `cache`
- `free`: Unused memory (MemFree and SwapFree in /proc/meminfo)
- `shared`: Memory used (mostly) by tmpfs (Shmem in /proc/meminfo)
- `buffers`: Memory used by kernel buffers (Buffers in /proc/meminfo)
- `cache`: Memory used by the pape cache and slabs (Cached and SReclaimable in /proc/meminfo)
- `available`: Estimation of how much is available for starting new application. This includes `cache`.

`used` + `free` + `buff` + `cache` = `total`


~~~sh
sar -r 1
